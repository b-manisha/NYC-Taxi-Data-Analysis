# NYC-Taxi-Data-Analysis
Objective:
Design and implement a robust data engineering pipeline that ingests, cleans, transforms, and models large-scale taxi trip data to derive actionable insights. The project will simulate a real-world scenario where a transportation authority or analytics firm needs to understand taxi operations, optimize routes, analyze demand patterns, and forecast future trends.

Key Tasks:

Data Ingestion & Integration:

Set up an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to automate the ingestion of raw data.

Optionally integrate supplementary data (e.g., weather or event data) to enrich the analysis.

Data Wrangling & Transformation:

Clean the data by handling missing values, erroneous records, and outliers.

Normalize or standardize fields as necessary (e.g., date-time conversions, location coordinates).

Data Modeling & Schema Design:

Create dimensional models (fact and dimension tables) for efficient analytical querying.

Consider a star or snowflake schema to support analytical dashboards or ad hoc queries.

Analytics & Reporting:

Build queries and simple dashboards (or reports) to answer questions like:

What are the peak hours for taxi demand?

How do weather conditions affect trip volumes and durations?

Which areas generate the highest revenue?

Optionally, integrate forecasting models to predict demand or revenue trends.

Scalability & Performance:

Optimize your pipeline for batch and potentially real-time data updates.

Consider performance improvements such as partitioning, indexing, or using distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark).
